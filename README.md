Welcome to my Data Science coding repository!

My name is Santana Caicedo and I am a Data Scientist. Here is a collection of projects where I utilize an array of skills and techiniques to analyze, clean, visualize Data.
I also create supervised and unsupervised models like linear regression and K-means clustering models to gain meaningful insight.
I am always looking to improve and expand my skill set so if you see something I could improve or explain better, leave a comment! 
Constructive criticism is always welcome !
